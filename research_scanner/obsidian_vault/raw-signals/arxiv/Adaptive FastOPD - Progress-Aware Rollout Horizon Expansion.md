## Curator Reasoning

High relevance to Artificial Intelligence research priorities identified during automated triage.

## Summary / Abstract

On-policy distillation (OPD) provides dense teacher supervision along student-generated trajectories, but its online rollout process incurs substantial computational cost, particularly when a few long responses delay batch completion. Existing acceleration methods typically control rollout length using fixed budgets or absolute teacher--student agreement thresholds, which may not reflect learning progress across different models and training stages. We propose Adaptive FastOPD, a progress-aware strategy that expands the rollout horizon only when learning near the current boundary region has plateaued and the current horizon is sufficiently utilized. The former is determined from four teacher--student signals measured relative to their values upon entering each horizon, making expansion responsive to stage-specific progress rather than a predefined step interval or an absolute threshold on the raw agreement signals, while the latter prevents a small number of long responses from triggering increases in rollout cost. Across two teacher--student pairs, Adaptive FastOPD achieves the highest average performance while reducing training time by 49.1--71.2\% relative to OPD 15K, and remains robust across a range of hyperparameter settings.
